### VOGLBot/AndreaBot
A set of Telegram bots made for the University Scholars Program's freshmen orientation.

* VOGLBot makes handling attendance and participant information easy and less clunky by relying on commands issued via Telegram
* AndreaBot handles announcements via a single interface and allows for group-based announcements. (*at the time of development/deployment, Telegram did not have read-only channels*)
* Both bots implemented using python3 and mongodb
* Users would issue simple text commands to perform CRUD operations for orientation attendees
